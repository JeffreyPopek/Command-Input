  emailText: "Your Drone operation so far has been sloppy to say the least. I\u2019ve
    given you some extra juice until now because your the new guy, but usually we
    only charge the drone exactly as much as needed to finish a job (it save on the
    electrical bill).Also, if the drone loses power with a job incomplete, the time
    lost recharging comes out of your paycheck. Did I forget to tell you that?"
