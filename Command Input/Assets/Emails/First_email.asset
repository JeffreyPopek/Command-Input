  emailText: "I\u2019m a busy man, and I have neither the time nor the interest to
    give you a \u201Cwelcome to the team\u201D speech. This training course will
    explain how to perform your duties as an Exotherm drone operator - it\u2019s
    so simple a toddler could do it, so finish it quickly and don\u2019t even think
    about trying to pad out your timecard by pretending you're too stupid to finish. "
